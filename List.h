     *	      b: [5, 1, 2]

     *     runtime:  O(1)
     *
     *     sanity:  this operation makes sense when a and b
     *		are distinct lists.  For example, we don't

     * description: compares the calling list with parameter list (other)
     *    "LEXICALLY" (essentially a generalization of dictionary
     *    ordering).
     *
     *    link:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order
     *
     *    Return Value:
     *
     *       o if the two lists are identical, 0 is returned.
     *       o if the calling list is lexically BEFORE the other list,
     *             -1 is returned
     *       o otherwise, the other list is lexically before the calling
     *             list and 1 (positive one) is returned.
     *
     *    Properties and examples:
     *
     *        The empty list is lexically before all non-empty lists
     *          (you can say it is "less than" all non-empty lists).
     *
     *        Examples (using mathematical notation):
     *
     *          [2 5 1] < [3 1 1 1 1]    (think dictionary ordering!)
     *
     *          [4 1 3] < [4 1 3 0 0 0]  (prefix: just like "car" is before
     *                                            "cartoon" in the dictionary).
     *
     *          [4 5 6 1 2 3 9 9 9] < [4 5 6 1 4 0 0]
     *                   ^                     ^
     *                      (they have a common prefix of length 4; but at
     *                      the fifth position they differ and the left list
     *                      is the winner (smaller) -- no need to look further)
     *
     *
     *        Templates?
     *
     *          Since List is a template class, the elements of a particular
     *          list need not be integers.  For example, we could have
     *          lists of strings.
     *
     *          Good news:  the exact same principle applies because
     *          strings can be compared just like integers can be compared!
     *
     *          Great news:  you don't need to think about this at all!
     *          The exact same code you would write if you assumed the element
     *          type is integer will work for other types like strings.
     *
     *          Why?  Because, for example, all of these operators:
     *
     *                   <, <=, ==, > and >=
     *
     *          all work on strings.  They are not 'built-in' to C++, but
     *          the class string has "overloaded" these operators (they
     *          result in an appropriate function call).
     *
     *          (In a subsequent exercise, we will do this kind of
     *          overloading ourselves!)
     *
     *        Examples with lists of strings:
     *
     *          ["egg", "goat"] > ["egg", "globe", "apple"]
     *
     *          ["zebra", "fun"] < ["zebra", "funny"]
     *
     *        [Yes, the components of these lists are THEMSELVES compared
     *        lexically, but the string class is doing those comparisons)
